Requires at least: 3.6
Tested up to: 4.3
Stable tag: .3

Adds features to PMPro to better manage grouped discount codes or large numbers of discount codes.

== Description ==

Adds the ability to create a single ‘parent’ discount code and bulk generate ‘child’ codes with the same settings. The parent code controls all of the pricing, expiration, allowed levels, etc. Once saved, each of the sub codes will act as if they have the same settings as the main code.

This is useful for bulk mailing, newsletters, or participation in a Groupon-type program.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'pmpro-group-discount-codes' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Memberships > Discount Codes.
1. Create a new discount code.
1. Under "Group Codes" enter one unique code per line (these can be auto-generated with any random string generator - https://www.random.org/strings/ - or in a spreadsheet program).
1. Set the pricing per level that the group of codes will apply to.
The "parent" code should be kept private with unlimited uses.
