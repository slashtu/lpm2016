Add PayPal Express as an Alternate Payment Option at Checkout

== Description ==

This plugin enables a radio select on the membership checkout page, allowing a user to pay onsite with your credit card payment gateway or to pay via PayPal.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'pmpro-add-paypal-express' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Set your PayPal Express API key, username, and password set in the PMPro Payment Settings.
1. After inputting your PayPal Express settings and clicking save, switch back to your primary gateway and save those settings. (The PayPal Express settings will be remembered "in the background".)

== Important Notes ==

You do not need to activate this plugin with PayPal Website Payments Pro. PayPal Express is automatically an option at checkout with that gateway.
	
This plugin will only work when the primary gateway is an onsite gateway. At this time, this includes:
* Stripe
* Braintree
* Authorize.net
* PayPal Payflow Pro
* Cybersource
