Creates member navigation menus and swaps your theme's navigation based on a user's Membership Level

== Description ==

Extend your theme to display unique navigation menus based on a user's membership level. 

This plugin duplicates all wp_nav_menus defined by your theme and creates a members version. Customize menus even further by optionally creating a level-specific navigation menu. This can be set on the Edit Membership Level screen under the "Navigation Menu" section.

If you do not set a Menu for a member-specific Theme Location, the menu will fall back to the default as defined by your theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-nav-menus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Optionally create level-specific navigation menus on the `Edit Membership Level` admin.
1. Create new navigation menu(s) for your members and assign them to the appropriate Theme Location.
